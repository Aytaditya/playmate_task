# Blockchain Wallet Connection Demonstration

## Overview

Due to several issues encountered with the initial codebase provided for this task, I created a new GitHub repository to demonstrate a simple wallet connection in blockchain technology. This repository showcases a functional implementation of wallet integration and is intended to address the recruitment task given by Playmate.
